<h2>Koramangala</h2>
<p>Koramangala is another of Bangalore’s hip and happening party and food districts, housing
restaurants specializing in any cuisine you can think of. It is 4 kms from Royal Orchid down a
straight road – the intermediate ring road. Koramangala has super interesting street-side joints,
standing shoulder to shoulder with their more sophisticated, up-market cousins. An interesting
Rajasthani place, a hole-in-the-wall Tibetian joint, Bhajji Carts, Pao Bhaji vans ... lots to explore in
this part of the city.</p>
